      <h1>Can you match neurotoxicants to sources of exposure?</h1>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <h4>
        Below the map, click on a card from each row to try a match between a
        neurotoxicant and a possible or common source of exposure for chidren or
        mothers. A correctly matched pair will be highlighted green. The
        background colors of cards are grouped by the broad category they belong
        to: HEAVY METALS (yellow), INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS & PESTICIDES (pink), and
        ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS (blue).
      </h4>
      <h4>
        To learn more about the various neurotoxicants, hover over pins on the
        map for more context, including evidence from studies described in
        <em>Environmental Neurotoxicants and Developing Brain</em> (Miodovnik
        2011). The location of a pin is based on the country where one of the
        mentioned studies took place.

        Note that the evidence popups and the environmental sources cards are
        not meant to provide exhaustive lists. Likewise, the 9 "neurotoxicants"
        below are only more well-known candidates for negatively impacting brain
        development early in life and for associations with neuropsychological,
        cognitive, or behavioral issues. But, as Miodovnik writes,<br />
        <em
          >"Only about 200 chemicals out of more than 80,000 registered with the
          United States Environmental Protection Agency have undergone extensive
          neurotoxicity testing, and many chemicals found in consumer goods are
          not required to undergo any neurodevelopmental testing."</em

      const studyInfo = {
        lead: `In 1892, many cases of lead poisoning in children were identified in Queensland, Australia 
        due to lead-based paint chips from home railings and walls. 
In the 1970s, two epidemiological studies in the U.S. found lead exposure to impair children's academic performance and neuropsychological scores. 
With federal regulations which mandated the reduction of industrial lead emissions and leaded gasoline, 
blood lead levels reduced by 80% over 1978 - 1991. 
However, an estimated 250,000 U.S. children aged 1-5 years still have levels above 10 Î¼g/dL. 
There is no threshold of safe exposure for children.`,
        mercury: `70% of mercury in the global fish supply comes from industrial emissions. 
        Atmospheric mercury returns to the ground through precipitation, becomes methylated by bacteria into a toxic 
        form of mercury called methylmercury (MeHg), and bioaccumulates in fish. 
        Large epidemiological studies have linked prenatal MeHg exposure from fish consumption 
        to adverse neurological outcomes in children. For example, in the Faroe Islands, children with higher 
        cord-blood MeHg levels showed poorer attention, motor and visual-spatial skills, language, and memory. 
        Not all studies have found consistent cognitive effects. 
        Nevertheless, there appears to be no safe threshold of MeHg exposure. 
        In adults, the damage seems more localized, 
        whereas in the developing brain, its effects are more widespread as it disrupts neuronal migration.`,
        arsenic: `In a 1955 incident in Japan, over 12,000 infants consumed arsenic-contaminated milk powder. 
        Subsequently, lower IQs and higher rates of mental retardation were found in survivors, 
        though exposure levels were not reported. In the U.S., one study linked arsenic exposure to a decline 
        in memory in children living near a waste site. 
        Several other studies also found small impairments in memory, attention, and intelligence 
        in children exposed to high levels of arsenic in drinking water. 
        However, studies vary in how they measured exposure and cognitive outcomes and 
        whether they isolated arsenic's effects from other co-contaminants.`,
        manganese: `Manganese is used in many industries like steel production, welding, and gasoline. 
        Exposure can also happen with contaminated water and manganese-based fungicides. 
        A study with primates found that blood manganese levels affected cognition and increased compulsive behaviors. 
        Human studies of children based in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, China, and Bangladesh have 
        linked higher levels of exposure to attention deficits, memory issues, hyperactivity, and/or lower IQ scores. 
        However, studies may differ in biomarkers used and control of interaction effects.`,
        pcb: `Polychlorinated Biphenyl Compounds (PCBs) were banned in the 1970s, but due to their high chemical stability, 
        remain prevalent in many products manufactured before 1979, such as electrical equipment, 
        caulking, and certain plastics, and are commonly found in landfills. 
        Over 10 longitudinal studies have linked prenatal exposure to PCBs from consuming contaminated fish 
        with modest negative outcomes in attention, memory, learning, IQ, and/or risk of ADHD. 
        For example, Stewart et al. (2008) found that 9-year-old boys who had been exposed to PCBs in the womb 
        had a 3-point drop in IQ per 1-ng/g increase in placental PCB.`,
        ops: `Organophosphate pesticides (OPs), when broken down in the body, inhibit an important enzyme called acetylcholinesterase. 
        An OP called Chlorpyrifos was banned from residential use in 2000 due to animal studies indicating its neurotoxicity. Epidemiological studies in New York City also linked prenatal exposure to chlorpyrifos, 
        which had been used in homes to control cockroach infestations, to developmental and behavioral issues in children. 
        However, chlorpyrifos and another OP called diazinon are still widely used in agriculture, 
        increasing risk for children near farm areas. 
        Unfortunately, animal studies suggest that newer replacements for banned OPs 
        may not be much better in terms of neurotoxic effects.`,
        phthalates: `Phthalates are plasticizers found in products like IV bags, food packaging, toys, and personal care items. 
        Prospective cohort studies indicate that prenatal exposure to phthalates may be linked to disruptive behavior 
        in children aged 5 to 9 and social impairments in adolescents, among other effects. 
        Kim et al. (2009, 2010) found associations with ADHD and poorer IQ scores in school-age children in South Korea.`,
        bpa: `Bisphenol A (BPA) is used in products like polycarbonate plastic bottles and epoxy resins 
        for canned goods. While concerns about its estrogen-like effects on reproduction are more well-known,  
        not as much focus has been on its effects on neurobehavioral functioning. However, animal studies have found BPA to alter brain development, 
        cognitive function, and hyperactivity in rodents. One human study linked prenatal BPA exposure 
        to increased aggression and hyperactivity, particularly in female toddlers.`,
        pbde: `Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are flame retardants found in products 
        like electronics, textiles, and furniture. Research suggests that prenatal exposure to PBDEs 
        is associated with behavioral changes, hyperactivity, impaired learning and memory, and neuronal death in mice or rats. 
        Interestingly, Roze et al. (2009) found both positive and negative outcomes 
        of prenatal PBDE exposure in their study with a group of 5-6 year old children in the Netherlands; 
        fine-motor skills and attention were poorer, but coordination, visual perception, and behavior scores were better.`,
